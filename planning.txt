1. Prompt user to enter decryption code (NOT the same as password)
    a. Decryption code explains how to modify the data stored in the db. Some sort of shift based on this decryption code
    b. Use Tink (Google product)!
2. Database with key/value pairs
    a. Key: Name of website (chosen by user, so Google or google.com both work)
    b. Value: Password (as found when using decryption code)
3. Add password by clicking generate a password, it promps you to enter any constraints (require upper, require lower, require nums, require punct, and no upper/lower/nums/punct)
    a. Probably check boxes
    b. Can also add passwords manually, if wanted
        c. Would have to confirm decryption code (probably twice), then type in the password

Currently using PostgreSQL, may eventually want to migrate onto AWS so that password suite can be accessed from anywhere

Note that the program will NOT tell you whether your initial decryption code is right or wrong, it'll just decrypt for you :D
